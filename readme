This is an edited version of CAMB_sources that computes the angular power spectrum for combination of DM tracers. 

Features:
- Allow for the HI Temperature as selection function; 
- computes the evolution bias for an HI IM experiments given the temperature;
- Allows for a general redshift distribution of sources dn/dz\propto z^alpha exp(-(z/z0)^beta);
- Has more observational window functions: top hat, smooth top hat and for the error function for photo-z surveys;
- allows for marginalisation over evolution bias, lensing and GR corrections to the angular power spectrum;
